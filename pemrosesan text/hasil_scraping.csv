Firstly, to improve networks SE and to extend networks lifetime simultaneously, we design a two-way FD relay transmission strategy with simultaneous wireless information and power transfer and direct links (DLs). The designed transmission strategy can complete a bidirectional communication in only one time slot with the exists of DLs and the energy-constrained relay node. With the designed transmission strategy, we further give the characteristics of relay amplification factor, the analysis of the designed transmission strategy, and the EE analysis of traditional half-duplex two-way amplify-and-forward relaying. Secondly, to maximize networks EE, we present both the EE maximization problems and analyses of the designed transmission strategy with equal power allocation and optimal power allocation. To solve the EE maximization problems, we further propose the alternating optimal algorithm and give complexity analysis of the algorithm. Simulations show that our designed transmission strategy can improve the SE and EE of the networks."

To this end, the general procedure of rubric development, including data preparation, selection, and refinement, was applied. The performance criteria were categorized into content, form, and delivery. Two groups of participants, experts, and students were recruited to establish the rubrics validity and reliability. Based on the statistical analysis, the developed analytic rubric was established as a valid tool for use in the Iranian academic context of consecutive interpreting assessment. The proposed rubric may provide novice trainers with a more objective and systematic tool for consecutive interpreting assessments."

To address this, our study develops robust, deep neural network (DNN)-based speech enhancement methods. We reproduce several DNN-based monaural speech enhancement methods and outline a strategy for constructing datasets. This strategy, validated through experimental reproductions, has effectively enhanced the denoising efficiency and robustness of the models. Then, we propose a causal speech enhancement system named Supervised Attention Multi-Scale Temporal Convolutional Network (SA-MSTCN). SA-MSTCN extracts the complex compressed spectrum (CCS) for input encoding and employs complex ratio masking (CRM) for output decoding. The supervised attention module, a lightweight addition to SA-MSTCN, guides feature extraction. Experiment results show that the supervised attention module effectively improves noise reduction performance with a minor increase in computational cost. The multi-scale temporal convolutional network refines the perceptual field and better reconstructs the speech signal. Overall, SA-MSTCN not only achieves state-of-the-art speech quality and intelligibility compared to other methods but also maintains stable denoising performance across various environments."

In the context of sequential data, filtering refers to the probability distribution of the underlying Markovian system given the measurements made at or before the time of the estimated state. In addition to the filtering, the smoothing distribution is obtained from incorporating measurements made after the time of the estimated state into the filtered solution. This work proposes a number of new filters and smoothers that, in contrast to the traditional schemes, systematically make use of the process noises to give rise to enhanced performances in addressing the state estimation problem. In doing so, our approaches for the resolution are characterized by the application of the graphical models; the graph-based framework not only provides a unified perspective on the existing filters and smoothers but leads us to design new algorithms in a consistent and comprehensible manner. Moreover, the graph models facilitate the implementation of the suggested algorithms through message passing on the graph."

VIP often face challenges in learning and using Braille, and even with existing equipment, including smart technologies, they frequently experience aesthetic and emotional discomfort beyond usability and accessibility. The interdisciplinary research team conducted mixed-method research following the double diamond module of the design thinking process. Initially, qualitative interviews to analyze VIPs Braille utilization were conducted to derive design factors. Subsequently, identified design factors were applied to conduct experiments with appropriate embroidery methods and connection structures using MXene-coated yarn. The strategies effectively enhanced pressure sensing performance by two times and realized highly localized and independent sensing to enable Braille recognition. Finally, a specific design for the wearable Braille recognition glove was proposed that incorporated these findings. The proposed wearable glove, equipped with a high-performance Braille recognition sensor, is designed to enhance the psychological and aesthetic satisfaction of VIP. The gloves universal design and accompanying technical support allow VIP to maintain their existing Braille reading methods while enjoying enhanced performance and avoiding social stigmas."

However, traditional EEG-based emotion recognition methods ignore the spatial correlation between electrodes. To address this problem, this paper proposes an EEG-based emotion recognition method combining differential entropy feature matrix (DEFM) and 2D-CNN-LSTM. In this work, first, the one-dimensional EEG vector sequence is converted into a two-dimensional grid matrix sequence, which corresponds to the distribution of brain regions of the EEG electrode positions, and can better characterize the spatial correlation between the EEG signals of multiple adjacent electrodes. Then, the EEG signal is divided into equal time windows, and the differential entropy (DE) of each electrode in this time window is calculated, it is combined with a two-dimensional grid matrix and differential entropy to obtain a new data representation that can capture the spatiotemporal correlation of the EEG signal, which is called DEFM. Secondly, we use 2D-CNN-LSTM to accurately identify the emotional categories contained in the EEG signals and finally classify them through the fully connected layer. Experiments are conducted on the widely used DEAP dataset. Experimental results show that the method achieves an average classification accuracy of 91.92% and 92.31% for valence and arousal, respectively. The method performs outstandingly in emotion recognition. This method effectively combines the temporal and spatial correlation of EEG signals, improves the accuracy and robustness of EEG emotion recognition, and has broad application prospects in the field of emotion classification and recognition based on EEG signals."

The effects of interactionist versus interventionist dynamic assessment models on Iranian EFL learners’ speaking sub-skills: a mixed-method study
",Asian-Pacific Journal of Second and Foreign Language Education,N/A,"Saeid Sarabi Asl, Mojgan Rashtchi and Ghafour Rezaie",8 April 2024,https://sfleducation.springeropen.com/articles/10.1186/s40862-023-00237-x,https://sfleducation.springeropen.com/counter/pdf/10.1186/s40862-023-00237-x.pdf,"Dynamic assessment has been proven to effectively promote EFL learners' speaking proficiency, but its implementation in teaching speaking skills has been limited. One of the main reasons is that, thus far, very few studies have scrutinized the impacts of its two main models, interactionist and interventionist, on the speaking sub-skills of EFL learners. Instead of examining speaking as a general skill, this research focused on four speaking sub-skills, including grammatical range and accuracy, vocabulary, fluency, and pronunciation, with a concurrent experimental mixed-method design. To this aim, 30 undergraduate students from the Islamic Azad University, North Tehran Branch, were recruited through convenience sampling and participated in both phases. The quantitative data were collected from participants' pre-and post-test scores in the IELTS speaking module, and qualitative data consisted of the transcribed recordings of the intervention sessions. The integration of the quantitative and qualitative results revealed that while both models positively affected EFL learners' speaking proficiency, they differed in the extent and mechanisms of their impacts. The interactionist DA effectively improved grammatical range and accuracy, pronunciation, and vocabulary depth, and the interventionist DA enhanced fluency and vocabulary breadth more efficiently. The findings dissect the differential effects of DA models in one-to-one speaking lessons, offering practical insights for ELT practitioners and stakeholders."

A multi-agent context-aware model employing the belief-desire-intention (BDI) reasoning mechanism is proposed. This model utilizes a semantic knowledge-based intelligent reasoning network to monitor suspicious activities within a prohibited zone, generating alerts. Additionally, a BDI intelligent multi-level data transmission routing algorithm is proposed to optimize energy consumption constraints and enhance energy-awareness among nodes. The energy optimization analysis involves the Energy Percent Dataset, showcasing the efficiency of four wireless sensor network techniques (E-FEERP, GTEB, HHO-UCRA, EEIMWSN) in maintaining high energy levels. E-FEERP consistently exhibits superior energy efficiency (93 to 98%), emphasizing its effectiveness. The Energy Consumption Dataset provides insights into the joule measurements of energy consumption for each technique, highlighting their diverse energy efficiency characteristics. Latency measurements are presented for four techniques within a fixed transmission range of 5000 m. E-FEERP demonstrates latency ranging from 3.0 to 4.0 s, while multi-hop latency values range from 2.7 to 2.9 s. These values provide valuable insights into the performance characteristics of each technique under specified conditions. The Packet Delivery Ratio (PDR) dataset reveals the consistent performance of the techniques in maintaining successful packet delivery within the specified transmission range. E-FEERP achieves PDR values between 89.5 and 92.3%, demonstrating its reliability. The Packet Received Data further illustrates the efficiency of each technique in receiving transmitted packets. Moreover the network lifetime results show E-FEERP consistently improving from 2550 s to round 925. GTEB and HHO-UCRA exhibit fluctuations around 3100 and 3600 s, indicating variable performance. In contrast, EEIMWSN consistently improves from round 1250 to 4500 s."

Artificial Intelligence (AI) algorithms are widely used to diagnose and track the progression of this disease, which causes symptoms of Parkinson's disease in its early stages, by predicting the results of the Unified Parkinson's Disease Rating Scale (UPDRS). In this study, we aim to develop a method based on the integration of two methods, one complementary to the other, Ensembles of Self-Organizing Map and Neuro-Fuzzy, and an unsupervised learning algorithm. The proposed method relied on the higher effect of the variables resulting from the analysis of the initial readings to obtain a correct and accurate preliminary prediction. We evaluate the developed approach on a PD dataset including speech cues. The process was evaluated with root mean square error (RMSE) and modified R square (modified R2). Our findings reveal that the proposed method is effective in predicting UPDRS outcomes by a combination of speech signals (measures of hoarseness). As the preliminary results during the evaluation showed numbers that proved the worth of the proposed method, such as UPDRS=0.955 and RMSE approximately 0.2769 during the prediction process."

Due to its importance, several expressions of the CramrRao Bound (CRB) and Maximum Likelihood Estimation (MLE) have been derived over the years. Previous contributions started from the assumption that the transmission process introduces an unknown phase, which hindered the explicit consideration of the time-delay parameter in the carrier-phase component in theoretical derivations. However, this contribution takes into account this additional term under the assumption that such an unknown phase is inferred and compensated for. This new condition leads to the derivation of a novel MLE. Subsequently, a closed-form expression of the achievable Mean Squared Error (MSE) for the time-delay and Doppler parameters is provided for the asymptotic region, assuming the signal is band-limited. Both expressions are validated via Monte Carlo simulations. This analysis reveals five distinct regions of operation of the MLE, refining existing knowledge and providing valuable insights into time-delay estimation"

In particular, data acquired from wearable devices often suffer from a low timestamp precision or clock drift. Current state-of-the-art methods such as Pearson Cross-Correlation are sensitive to typical data quality issues, e.g. misdetected events, and Dynamic Time Warping is computationally expensive. To overcome these limitations, we propose Nearest Advocate, a novel event-based time delay estimation method for multi-sensor time-series data synchronisation. We evaluate its performance using three independent datasets acquired from wearable sensor systems, demonstrating its superior precision, particularly for short, noisy time-series with missing events. Additionally, we introduce a sparse variant that balances precision and runtime. Finally, we demonstrate how Nearest Advocate can be used to solve the problem of linear as well as non-linear clock drifts. Thus, Nearest Advocate offers a promising opportunity for time delay estimation and post-hoc synchronization for challenging datasets across various applications."

Wi-Fi network security is severely questioned since there is no physical barrier separating a wireless network from a wired network, and the security procedures in place are defenseless against a wide range of threats. This study set out to assess federated learning, a new technique, as a possible remedy for privacy issues and the high expense of data collecting in network attack detection. To detect and identify cyber threats, especially in Wi-Fi networks, the research presents FEDDBN-IDS, a revolutionary intrusion detection system (IDS) that makes use of deep belief networks (DBNs) inside a federated deep learning (FDL) framework. Every device has a pre-trained DBN with stacking restricted Boltzmann machines (RBM) to learn low-dimensional characteristics from unlabelled local and private data. Later, these models are combined by a central server using federated learning (FL) to create a global model. The whole model is then enhanced by the central server with fully linked SoftMax layers to form a supervised neural network, which is then trained using publicly accessible labeled AWID datasets. Our federated technique produces a high degree of classification accuracy, ranging from 88% to 98%, according to the results of our studies."

Clustering and ordination techniques were used to perform multivariate analyses on Rovash scripts and inscriptions. The study presents two new measures, the script-specific holophyletic index and the joint holophyletic index, for evaluating trees produced by hierarchical clustering. The results indicate that holophyletic indices can validate the traditional assignment of inscriptions to scripts through phylogenetic tree evaluation. This method can be extended to include pattern systems with evolutionary properties and graph sequences derived from them, as well as additional scripts and inscriptions."

Drawing on a qualitative methodology that amalgamates socio-semiotic analysis and critical visual literacy, the investigation scrutinizes the portrayal of indigenous peoples within 12 EFL coursebooks used in state-run and subsidized schools across Chile. Furthermore, the research explores the viewpoints and attitudes of seven EFL teachers towards the visual representations of indigenous peoples compared to non-indigenous individuals depicted in the same coursebooks. The findings suggest that indigenous peoples are often depicted as stereotypical remnants of the past, oversimplifying their intricate cultural attributes and presenting them as disconnected from contemporary society. Moreover, the study identifies the failure of coursebook publishers in acknowledging the richness and diversity of indigenous cultures, thereby perpetuating cultural stereotypes and contributing to the process of otherising, which reinforces a sense of separation between the majority (us) and the indigenous minority (them)."

In this paper, a novel method (BCP-HI) is proposed to enhance the accuracy of outlier detection in GNSS coordinate time series by combining Bayesian change point (BCP) analysis and the Hampel identifier (HI). By using BCP, change points (cps) in the time series are lidentified, and so the time series is divided into subsegments that have properties of a normal distribution. In each of these separated segments, outliers are detected using HI. Each data element identified as an outlier is corrected by a median filter of window size (w) to obtain the corrected signal. The BCP-HI method was tested on both simulated and real GNSS coordinate time series. Outliers from three different synthetic test datasets with different sampling frequencies and outlier amplitudes were detected with approximately 98% accuracy after processing. After this process, Signal-to-Noise Ratio (SNR) increased from 0.0084 to 10.8714dB and Root Mean Square (RMS) decreased from 24 to 23mm. Similarly, for real GNSS data, approximately 98% accuracy was achieved, with an increase in SNR from 0.0003 to 4.4082dB and a decrease in RMS from 7.6 to 6.6mm observed. In addition, the output signals after BCP-HI were examined graphically using LombScargle periodograms and it was observed that clearer power spectrum distributions emerged. When the input and output signals were examined using the KolmogorovSmirnov (KS) test, they were found to be statistically similar. These results indicate that the BCP-HI algorithm effectively removes outliers, and enhances processing accuracy and reliability, and improves signal quality."

Effective AED techniques rely heavily on supervised or semi-supervised models to capture the wide range of dynamics spanned by sound events in order to achieve temporally precise boundaries and accurate event classification. These methods require extensive collections of labeled or weakly labeled in-domain data, which is costly and labor-intensive. Importantly, these approaches do not fully leverage the inherent variability and range of dynamics across sound events, aspects that can be effectively identified through unsupervised methods. The present work proposes an approach based on multi-rate autoencoders that are pretrained in an unsupervised way to leverage unlabeled audio data and ultimately learn the rich temporal dynamics inherent in natural sound events. This approach utilizes parallel autoencoders that achieve decompositions of the modulation spectrum along different bands. In addition, we introduce a rate-selective temporal contrastive loss to align the training objective with event detection metrics. Optimizing the configuration of multi-rate encoders and the temporal contrastive loss leads to notable improvements in domestic sound event detection in the context of the DCASE challenge."

In this study, we recommend a novel and robust model, named DeepDet, based on deep-layered architecture, to categorize speech into two classes: spoofed and bonafide. DeepDet is an improved model based on Yet Another Mobile Network (YAMNet) employing a customized MobileNet combined with a bottleneck attention module (BAM). First, we convert audio into mel-spectrograms that consist of timefrequency representationson mel-scale. Second, we trained our deep layered model using the extracted mel-spectrograms on a Logical Access (LA) set, including synthesized speeches and voice conversions of the ASVspoof-2019 dataset. In the end, we classified the audios, utilizing our trained binary classifier. More precisely, we utilized the power of layered architecture and guided attention that can discern the spoofed speech from bonafide samples. Our proposed improved model employs depth-wise linearly separate convolutions, which makes our model lighter weight than existing techniques. Furthermore, we implemented extensive experiments to assess the performance of the suggested model using the ASVspoof 2019 corpus. We attained an equal error rate (EER) of 0.042% on Logical Access (LA), whereas 0.43% on Physical Access (PA) attacks. Therefore, the performance of the proposed model is significant on the ASVspoof 2019 dataset and indicates the effectiveness of the DeepDet over existing spoofing detectors. Additionally, our proposed model is robust enough that can identify the unseen spoofed audios and classifies the severalattacks accurately."

However, these methods face challenges in expressing uncertain factors (such as wind load, temperature load, and other variables, etc.). These problems directly impact the timeliness and accuracy of bridge early warning. This study develops an innovative method for bridge dynamic early warning with high versatility and accuracy. Long short-term memory network model (LSTM), expectation maximization (EM) and Gaussian mixture model (GMM) were employed in the proposed method. Firstly, the LSTM model is used to predict the measured monitoring data (such as deflection, strain, cable force, etc.) in real time to obtain the predicted results. Next, the number of clusters for the EM-GMM model is determined using the Calinski-Harabasz (CH) index. The method aims to comprehensively consider the internal cohesion of the clustering, ensuring accurate and reliable clustering results. Then, the EM-GMM model is used to cluster the random influence error and the predicted value, which can get the probabilistic prediction result of each corresponding random influence error. On this basis, the dynamic early warning interval under 95% confidence level is constructed. This facilitates early warning and decision-making for potential structural abnormalities. Finally, the accuracy and practicability of the method are verified by the comparison of engineering applications and existing specifications. The results demonstrate that the probabilistic early warning method considering the uncertain factors in the complex service environment can accurately achieve the dynamic early warning of bridges."

In this article, we propose a technique for soundfield synthesis through more easily deployable irregular loudspeaker arrays, i.e., where the spacing between loudspeakers is not constant, based on deep learning. The input are the driving signals obtained through a plane wave decomposition-based technique. While the considered driving signals are able to correctly reproduce the soundfield with a regular array, they show degraded performances when using irregular setups. Through a complex-valued convolutional neural network (CNN), we modify the driving signals in order to compensate the errors in the reproduction of the desired soundfield. Since no ground truth driving signals are available for the compensated ones, we train the model by calculating the loss between the desired soundfield at a number of control points and the one obtained through the driving signals estimated by the network. The proposed model must be retrained for each irregular loudspeaker array configuration. Numerical results show better reproduction accuracy with respect to the plane wave decomposition-based technique, pressure-matching approach, and linear optimizers for driving signal compensation."

In such situations, device-to-device (D2D) communication can be a helpful choice since it allows user equipment (UE) that is close to one another to connect directly, bypassing the cellular network infrastructure. The primary focus of this thesis is the application of D2D communication in a decentralized emergency scenario with a damaged eNodeB. The main objective is to find an appropriate strategy for finding and selecting D2D couples by simulating several methods in MATLAB. This study compares three D2D pair selection algorithms: distance-based, Signal-to-Interference and Noise Ratio (SINR)-based, and data rate-based distance-based. The simulation results show that the data rate-based strategy is the most effective method for selecting D2D couples in emergency scenarios. In contrast to algorithms that rely on distance and SINR, this one reduces the chance of an outage by 20%. Bit error rate (BER), capacity, spectral efficiency, and energy efficiency are the three types of links that are assessed: direct links, relay links, and UE relay links. The results show that, with the lowest BER and maximum data throughput, the direct link is the most reliable and efficient communication option. However, the relay connection and the UE relay link show better overall spectral efficiency in comparison to the direct link, indicating their ability to transport more data per unit of bandwidth. The option that consumes the least energy among the three is the direct link. The study demonstrates the great potential of D2D communication in emergency scenarios where conventional communication infrastructure may not be available. The direct link is the most dependable and effective alternative for communication, according to the data, although the UE link can still function effectively in the event that the direct link is compromised. The data rate-based method is a useful strategy for finding and choosing D2D partners. The results of this study can direct the development of D2D emergency communication solutions in 5G networks."

The purpose of this study is to contribute to the ongoing C-Test validation project by providing evidence of fit to the Mokken scale analysis as a widely used nonparametric IRT model. A six-passage C-Test battery was analyzed using the monotone homogeneity model and the double monotonicity model of Mokken. Unidimensionality was evaluated using the automatic item selection procedure. Findings showed that the C-Test passages form a strong unidimensional scale, fit well to the monotone homogeneity model, and, after deleting one item, have a sufficient fit to the double monotonicity model. The findings also indicated that the items form a hierarchy, and persons can be located on an ordinal scale using their C-Test sum scores. Implications of the study for C-Test validity and application are discussed."

The conceptualization within a study becomes imperative to ascertain the corresponding variables and establish appropriate methodologies for their measurement. The willingness to communicate (WTC) concept, an individuals engagement in communication when given the opportunity, has become a crucial point in second language (L2) learning due to language use and communication. While studies have rendered valuable insights into the differing presentations of L1 WTC and L2 WTC, the subject remains largely unexplored concerning the conceptualization and assessment of L2 WTC in the digital settings and English as a foreign language (EFL) context. The scoping review can aid in advancing our knowledge in this area of investigation by exploring the scope of available research literature on a topic by identifying key concepts and sources of evidence as well as identifying strengths, weaknesses, and gaps in the research that inform practice in the field, deepen assessors knowledge in the field, and highlight areas that require further inquiry. This study conducted a five-stage scoping review, including (1) establishing the scoping review questions, (2) identifying the related research, (3) determining the inclusion criteria of studies, (4) outlining the data, and (5) analyzing and reporting the results. Six databases, ERIC (ProQuest), APA PsycINFO, JSTORE, Elsevier (Scopus), Web of Science Core Collection, and Semantic Scholar, were used for scoping data. Forty-seven studies were included in the final analysis. The results discuss the WTC conceptualizations and their directions in L1, L2, and EFL contexts. Furthermore, the results discuss the conceptualization of classroom-centered and context-bounded WTC, operationalization of WTC in digital and EFL contexts, methodological approaches applied for evaluating WTC, the evaluation of teachers status in WTC conceptualization, and future directions. The discussions would prove useful in expanding our understanding of how to act toward L2 WTC and the assessment knowledge. Moreover, they would have significant implications for teachers, researchers, assessors, and practitioners in this field. Further, we hope this paper sparks renewed interest in L2 WTC by generating new ideas for researchers to conduct further research."

Because of the distinctive characteristics of IoV, such as the varied compute and communication capacities of network nodes, it is difficult to process jobs that are time-sensitive. The purpose of this study is to investigate the ways in which cloud computing may collaborate with the IoV to make the processing of time-sensitive procedures easier. We propose a vehicle design that makes advantage of cloud computing as a means of accomplishing this goal. Increasing the proportion of time-sensitive jobs that are ultimately completed was the motivation behind the development of the offloading model that we devised. Taking this into perspective, we present an adaptive task offloading and transmission method. Taking into account the ever-changing requirements and constraints on the available resources, this algorithm dynamically organizes all of the tasks into separate cloud link lists on the cloud. Following that, the tasks contained within each list are distributed in a cooperative manner to a number of different nodes, with the characteristics of those nodes being taken into consideration. Following the presentation of the simulation model, we carried out an experimental investigation into the effectiveness of the model that was proposed. It is abundantly evident that the proposed model is effective, as indicated by the findings."

A popular recent method, mixup, uses convex combinations of pairs of original samples to generate new samples. However, as we show in our experiments, mixup can produce undesirable synthetic samples, where the data is sampled off the manifold and can contain incorrect labels. We propose \(\zeta \)-mixup, a generalization of mixup with provably and demonstrably desirable properties that allows convex combinations of \({T} \ge 2\) samples, leading to more realistic and diverse outputs that incorporate information from \({T}\) original samples by using a p-series interpolant. We show that, compared to mixup, \(\zeta \)-mixup better preserves the intrinsic dimensionality of the original datasets, which is a desirable property for training generalizable models. Furthermore, we show that our implementation of \(\zeta \)-mixup is faster than mixup, and extensive evaluation on controlled synthetic and 26 diverse real-world natural and medical image classification datasets shows that \(\zeta \)-mixup outperforms mixup, CutMix,and traditional data augmentation techniques.

Efficient and automatic detection of rumors in social platforms hence has become an important research direction in recent years. This paper leverages deep learning methods to mine the changing trend of user features related to rumor events, and designs a rumor detection model called Time Based User Feature Capture Model(TBUFCM). To obtain a new feature vector representing the user's comprehensive features under the current event, the proposed model first recomputes the user feature vector by using feature enhancement function. Then it utilizes GRU(Gate Recurrent Unit, GRU) and CNN(Convolutional Neural Networks, CNN) models to learn the global and local changes of user features, respectively. Finally, the hidden rumor features in the process of rumor propagation can be discovered by user and time information. The experimental results show that TBUFCM outperforms the baseline model, and when there are only 20 forwarded posts, it can also reach an accuracy of 92%.

These requirements include low latency, high reliability, and large bandwidth. Consequently, power heterogeneous communication networks face the challenge of maintaining quality of service (QoS) while enhancing network resource utilization. Therefore, this paper puts forward a highly efficient optimization algorithm for resource slicing and scheduling in power heterogeneous communication networks. Our first step involves establishing an architectural description model of heterogeneous wireless networks for electric power based on hypergraph. This model characterizes complex dynamic relationships among service requirements, virtual networks, and physical networks. The system congruence entropy characterizes the degree of matching between the service demand and resource supply. Then an optimization problem is formed to maximize the system congruence entropy through dynamic resource allocation. To solve this problem, a joint resource allocation and routing method based on Lagrangian dual decomposition is proposed. These methods provide the optimal solutions of the nodes and link mappings of service function chains. The simulation results demonstrate that the proposed algorithm in this paper can greatly enhance resource utilization and also meet the QoS requirements of various services."

They are now a major news source worldwide, leading to the online proliferation of Fake News (FNs). These FNs are alarming because they fundamentally reshape public opinion, which may cause customers to leave these online platforms, threatening the reputations of several organizations and industries. This rapid dissemination of FNs makes it imperative for automated systems to detect them, encouraging many researchers to propose various systems to classify news articles and detect FNs automatically. In this paper, a Fake News Detection (FND) methodology is presented based on an effective IBAVO-AO algorithm, which stands for hybridization of African Vultures Optimization (AVO) and Aquila Optimization (AO) algorithms, with an extreme gradient boosting Tree (Xgb-Tree) classifier. The suggested methodology involves three main phases: Initially, the unstructured FNs dataset is analyzed, and the essential features are extracted by tokenizing, encoding, and padding the input news words into a sequence of integers utilizing the GLOVE approach. Then, the extracted features are filtered using the effective Relief algorithm to select only the appropriate ones. Finally, the recovered features are used to classify the news items using the suggested IBAVO-AO algorithm based on the Xgb-Tree classifier. Hence, the suggested methodology is distinguished from prior models in that it performs automatic data pre-processing, optimization, and classification tasks. The proposed methodology is carried out on the ISOT-FNs dataset, containing more than 44 thousand multiple news articles divided into truthful and fake. We validated the proposed methodologys reliability by examining numerous evaluation metrics involving accuracy, fitness values, the number of selected features, Kappa, Precision, Recall, F1-score, Specificity, Sensitivity, ROC_AUC, and MCC. Then, the proposed methodology is compared against the most common meta-heuristic optimization algorithms utilizing the ISOT-FNs. The experimental results reveal that the suggested methodology achieved optimal classification accuracy and F1-score and successfully categorized more than 92.5% of news articles compared to its peers. This study will assist researchers in expanding their understanding of meta-heuristic optimization algorithms applications for FND."

To address these three problems, we developed a reliable improved fourth-order spectral analysis (SPECAN) algorithm for highly squinted SAR imaging in this study. First, we present a fourth-order phase model (FoPM) that is more suitable for the highly squinted SAR system through a theoretical analysis. Second, based on the FoPM, we derive an improved fourth-order SPECAN algorithm in detail. In this derivation, the nonzero Doppler centroid, the ASLD, and the RCM caused by the high squint angle are corrected. Moreover, the whole simulation procedure of the improved algorithm only contains fast Fourier transform and complex multiplication, so the proposed algorithm can efficiently process highly squinted SAR echoes. Furthermore, the results of a comparison with the traditional SPECAN algorithm show the better performance of the proposed algorithm."

In this article we carry out a systematic, critical review of the regional literature along three thematic axes: legal analyses, normative and explanatory studies. Based on the review of 108 journal articles, we describe the characteristics, main contributions and research gaps of each thematic area. By analyzing legal norms and policy implementation gaps, existing studies on Latin America provide an understanding of migration policy over time and offer important empirical evidence for the advancement of political migration theory, challenging some of the main assumptions attributed to policies in the Global South. However, the lack of engagement with the broader literature and the absence of systematic analyses of its determinants and effects significantly limit the potential of this body of work. We close by making concrete suggestions of how future studies could fill existing gaps both in theoretical and empirical terms, and which methodological approach should be employed."

The proposed ITCSR algorithm enhances the performance of sparse graph signal reconstruction by introducing a threshold function to determine a suitable threshold. Furthermore, we demonstrate that the suitable parameters for the threshold can be automatically determined by leveraging the sparrow search algorithm. Moreover, we analytically prove the convergence property of the proposed ITCSR algorithm. In the experimental, numerical tests with synthetic as well as 3D point cloud data demonstrate the merits of the proposed ITCSR algorithm relative to the baseline algorithms."

This study aimed to augment the understanding of VI marketing by exploring the relationship between VIs characteristics (i.e., their humanlikeness level and operator type), their social media post characteristics (i.e., emotional expression, use of pronouns, use of punctuation marks), and consumer engagement. The analysis of three popular VIs Instagram profiles and posts revealed that VIs with less humanlike appearances tend to exhibit stronger positive emotional expressions. Interestingly, the level of humanlikeness in appearance was not associated with VI's other post characteristics, suggesting other intrinsic factors (e.g., the VIs character and virtual universe) may play a pivotal role. Whether a brand operates the VI or not made a statistically significant difference in the VIs post characteristics. Assessment of user engagement metrics (i.e., number of likes and comments) showed that users prefer hyper-realistic VIs and VIs operated by non-brand agencies, underscoring the importance of perceived authenticity in the digital realm.

This paper introduces a novel trajectory planning scheme, namely the double-map assisted UAV approach, which leverages deep reinforcement learning to address these challenges.

Furthermore, the connectivity and obstacle information collected by the UAV during flight are utilized to generate a map of radio and environmental data for simulating the flying process, thereby significantly reducing operational costs. The numerical results demonstrate that the proposed method effectively circumvents obstacles and areas with weak connections during flight, while also considering mission completion time."

Existing approaches focus on inferring static graph, typically assuming that all nodes are available. However, these approaches ignore the situation where only a subset of nodes are available from spatiotemporal measurements, and the remaining nodes are never observed due to application-specific constraints, resulting in time-varying graph estimation accuracy declines dramatically. To handle this problem, we propose a framework that consider the presence of hidden nodes to identify time-varying graph. Specifically, we assume that the graph signals are smooth and stationary on the graphs and only a small number of edges are allowed to change between two consecutive graphs. With these assumptions, we present a challenging time-varying graph inference problem, which models the influence of hidden nodes in terms of estimating the graph-shift operator matrices that have a form of graph Laplacian. Moreover, we emphasize similar edge pattern (column-sparsity) between different graphs. Finally, our method is evaluated on both synthetic and real-world data. The experimental results demonstrate the advantage of our method when compared to existing benchmarking methods."

These interferences have a straightforward structure, leading to the creation of complex circles when attempting to identify their contribution. To address the interference and improve the situation, we calculate the maximum likelihood estimator for the relevant parameters (time delay and Doppler shift) while considering the presence of these latent variables.

D2D resource allocation involves dividing vital resources, such as time, power, and spectrum, among several devices. Each device can connect to other devices via one or more frequency channels. D2D communication shares the cellular user resources, while signal power transmission causes interference to the users who share the same channel. So, there is a need to control the power of the D2D device to prevent interference. For proper power control and optimization of multi-channel D2D communication, which is a challenging task, we proposed a deep learning approach incorporating a hybrid resource allocation framework. This framework aims to increase the sum rate of D2D user equipment (DUE) while considering quality of service (QoS) factors like limiting interference to cellular user equipment (CUE) and guaranteeing individual DUE rates above a certain threshold. The proposed resource allocation scheme combines two methods, namely a metaheuristic hybrid particle swarm Cauchy approach to African vulture optimization (HPSCAV) and a modified long short-term memory (MLSTM) based approach. The HPSCAV scheme helps to ensure that the QoS constraints are met, while the MLSTM-based approach is utilized for efficient resource allocation by optimizing the power and improving it with HPSCAV. Simulation results validate that the proposed model achieved better performance in various metrics such as system capacity, power consumption, spectral efficiency (SE), and energy efficiency (EE)."

In this article, we propose a new task offloading scheme for smart devices in the modern battlefield area. By the integrative platform of TBs, UAVs and smart devices, the main challenges are (i) providing a task splitting algorithm for the partial offloading service, and (ii) develop a TB resource sharing algorithm to handle the offloading requests. For convenient wireless communications, UAVs work as relay nodes between TBs and individual devices. To achieve a mutually desirable solution, our proposed scheme is formulated as cooperative game models. First, the sequential Raiffa bargaining solution is applied to split the computation-intensive task of each smart device in the battlefield area. Second, the average-surplus value is adopted to effectively share the TB computing resource. Based on the reciprocal combination of two cooperative game solutions, we explore the sequential interaction of TBs, UAVs and battlefield devices, and jointly design our integrated control scheme for offloading services. According to the synergy effect, our hybrid approach can provide a fair-efficient solution in the UAV-TB-assisted battlefield network infrastructure.

Ambient backscatter communication enables Internet of Things devices to transmit data by reflecting and modulating ambient radio waves, eliminating the need for additional wireless channels, and reducing energy consumption and cost for sensors. However, passive ambient backscatter communication has limitations such as limited range and poor communication quality. By utilizing UAVs as communication nodes, these limitations can be overcome, expanding the communication range and improving the quality of communication. Although some research has been conducted on combining UAVs and ambient backscatter, several challenges remain. One key challenge is the strong direct link interference in ambient backscatter under UAV conditions, which significantly affects communication quality. In this paper, we propose an intelligent backward and forward straight link interference cancellation algorithm based on NOMA decoding technique to enhance ambient backscatter communication quality under UAV conditions and extract more ambient energy for UAV energy supply. The paper includes theoretical derivation, algorithm description, and simulation analysis to validate the error bit rate of labeled information bits. The results demonstrate that the forward algorithm reduces the error bit rate by approximately 20% under low signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) conditions, while the backward algorithm reduces the error bit rate under high SNR conditions. The combination of the forward and backward algorithms reduces the error bit rate under both high and low SNR conditions.

Existing methods for detecting abnormal trajectories primarily focus on comparing the spatial characteristics of the trajectories. However, they fail to capture the temporal dimensions pattern and evolution within the trajectory data, thereby inadequately identifying the behavioral inertia of the target group. A few detection methods that incorporate spatiotemporal features have also failed to adequately analyze the spatiotemporal sequence evolution information; consequently, detection methods that ignore temporal and spatial correlations are too one-sided. Recurrent neural networks (RNNs), especially gate recurrent unit (GRU) that design reset and update gate control units, process nonlinear sequence processing capabilities, enabling effective extraction and analysis of both temporal and spatial characteristics. However, the basic GRU network model has limited expressive power and may not be able to adequately capture complex sequence patterns and semantic information. To address the above issues, an abnormal trajectory detection method based on the improved GRU model is proposed in cloud computing in this paper. To enhance the anomaly detection ability and training efficiency of relevant models, strictly control the input of irrelevant features and improve the model fitting effect, an improved model combining the random forest algorithm and fully connected layer network is designed. The method deconstructs spatiotemporal semantics through reset and update gated units, while effectively capturing feature evolution information and target behavioral inertia by leveraging the integration of features and nonlinear mapping capabilities of the fully connected layer network. The experimental results based on the GeoLife GPS trajectory dataset indicate that the proposed approach improves both generalization ability by 1% and reduces training cost by 31.68%.

Additionally, several analyses based on some term properties (i.e., in-language and foreign terms, and single-word and multi-word terms) are carried out to show the Whisper capability at retrieving terms that convey specific properties. Although the results obtained for some databases are far from being perfect (e.g., for broadcast news domain), this Whisper-based approach has obtained the best results on the challenge databases so far so that it presents a strong baseline system for the upcoming challenge, encouraging participants to improve it."
